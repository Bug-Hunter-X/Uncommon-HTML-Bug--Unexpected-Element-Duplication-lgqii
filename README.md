# Uncommon HTML Bug: Unexpected Element Duplication

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in HTML that can lead to unexpected element duplication. The bug occurs when attempting to append content to an element's innerHTML using the element's existing innerHTML. This approach is inefficient and can cause unintended side effects, particularly when dealing with complex DOM structures.

## Bug Description
The provided HTML code selects a div element, retrieves its existing innerHTML, and appends a new paragraph.  However, this will result in two div elements instead of a single one with updated innerHTML.

## Solution
The solution involves using DOM manipulation methods like `insertAdjacentHTML` for cleaner and more predictable results. Avoid directly modifying the `innerHTML` of an element with its own innerHTML.
